# Round-Robin-vs-SRTF


# Objective: 
Our goal was to compare the effeciency of Round-Robin and Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm. 


# Description:
We implemented Shortest Job First and Round-Robin scheduling algorithms using C Language. We took 
different number of processes and calculated their average waiting and turnaround time.


# Implementation:
10, 20, 30, and 40 processes were taken respectively for both the algorithms. The input to code is 
given through the filing (Respected files are also uploaded). The code is implemented in C language. 
We assume that the arrival time of all process was zero and for Round-Robin scheduling the time was 
8 units.
